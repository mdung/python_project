The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.
